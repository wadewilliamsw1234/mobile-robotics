# Mobile Robotics
My central repository for assignments from University of Michigan's course, [Mobile Robotics: Methods and Algorithms](https://github.com/UMich-CURLY-teaching/UMich-ROB-530-public).

## Course Description
Theory and application of probabilistic and geometric techniques for autonomous mobile robotics. This course presents and critically examines contemporary algorithms for robot perception. Topics include Bayesian filtering; stochastic representations of the environment; motion and sensor models for mobile robots; algorithms for mapping, localization; application to autonomous marine, ground, and air vehicles.
